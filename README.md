# Feather Server

A RuneScape private server framework, based on client build 718, loading a 742 cache. Using a Matrix codebase. 

## Getting Started

Place the contents of the cache zip into the /data/cache/ directory. 

[Cache Link - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14aR8FfgKceOdgFFs_VT0W3udWxcSKtTt/view?usp=sharing)

Run the server using `Launcher.java` or by running the jar from the command line using

`java -jar Feather742.jar`

Please note when launching via Jar, you will need to place the /data/ directory where the Jar file is located. Please see the attached screenshot. You can get this folder by downloading the repo as a zip.

The server may throw an error for /data/cache/ not being present. Make sure this is added!
